##### Entire Board Reflection
While I was pretty much told what to do at all times do to the instuctions that were very helpful, i did learn a couple new things that will probably be helpful in the future, one of those things was the split tool. The split tool allowed me to make a singular line cut and split the part in two. The other main thing that i was taught in this assignment was the move face tool. The move face tool is not very complicated at all and is really just a transfrom tool but shifting a face in a different direction, which is really nice to have.
