##### Entire Board Reflection
While I was pretty much told what to do at all times do to the instuctions that were very helpful, I did learn a couple new things that will probably be helpful in the future, one of those things was the split tool. The split tool allowed me to make a singular line cut and split the part in two. The other main thing that i was taught in this assignment was the move face tool. The move face tool is not very complicated at all and is really just a transfrom tool but shifting a face in a different direction, which is really nice to have.
#### Deck

The deck part of this Project was the easiest part of the three. The bending of the deck using the split tool was fun and something that I now know how to do and will use it more in the future.

#### Trucks

Making the trucks was quite simple if you just follow what the instructions tell you to do, when the trucks were changed it was also pretty easy to follow except for one part. The one time that I got stuck was when I changed something but something broke and it didn't break in the instuctions so I had to just figure it out myself.

#### Wheel and Bearing

The wheel and the bearing was the second easiest part because all that had to be done was a small sketch and the n a revolve and that was it. The only thing of intrest that actually happened was reminding myself how to do a revolve.
